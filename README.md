# API-with-LLM-Integration

This project demonstrates how to build a simple REST API using **FastAPI** with integration to **Ollama** (LLM - Large Language Model).  
The API exposes an endpoint `/generate` where users can send a prompt and receive AI-generated responses from the **Mistral** model.

## Features
- 🚀 FastAPI server (Uvicorn)  
- 🔑 API key authentication with a simple credit system  
- 🧠 Ollama integration (model: `mistral`)  
- 🧪 Test quickly with curl, Postman, or a small Python snippet  
- 🛠️ Optional: run with a Bash script or a Makefile
